lab assignment : 8-> virtual functions 
theory :
virtual function
pure virtual function and abstract base class 
virtual destructors 
friend functions 
friend class 

questions:
1.A book shop in Kathmandu valley sells books and DVD. Two classes Book and DVD are inherited from base class Media. The Media 
class has common data members such as title and publication. The class Book has data members such number_of_pages and that of DVD
has data members such as duration. Each class member has member functions such as readdata() amd showdata(). Write a program for 
modelling the class hierarchy for book shop and process objects of these classes using pointers to the base class.

2.Write a program to create a abstract class Polygon with length and height as its data member. Make area() a pure virtual
function and redefine it in derived class triangle and rectangle to calculate the respective area.

3.Write a program to find the transpose of a given matrix using the friend function.
